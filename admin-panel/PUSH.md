# Push to GitHub

Your code is committed and ready to push! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create a new GitHub repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `vbs-admin-panel`)
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/vbs-admin-panel.git`)

## Option 2: Use existing repository

If you already have a GitHub repository, use its URL.

## Push Commands

Run these commands in the `admin-panel` directory:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/vbs-admin-panel.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/vbs-admin-panel.git` with your actual repository URL.

## Done!

Your code is now on GitHub! 🎉
